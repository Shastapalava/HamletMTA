    "### What are we using:  \n",
    "1) The \"Discovery\" API is MTA's official developer resource to get real-time data from their NYC Bus Time service. You can get more information <a href=\"http://bustime.mta.info/wiki/Developers/Index\">here</a>  \n",
    "2) Kaggle's NYC Bus Data <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/stoney71/new-york-city-transport-statistics\">here</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### How are we using it:\n",
    "Using regression and classification techniques learned in class, we want to explore the following:  \n",
    "> 1. Based on a ~10 stops/lines how closely do the actual stop times reflect the posted bus\n",
    "schedules and what is the distribution around the scheduled time that busses actually\n",
    "arrive?\n",
    ">2. What environmental factors impact a buses schedule? What impact does time of day,\n",
    "temperature, and weather have?\n",
    ">3. What socioeconomic factors play into a buses schedule? Do we see better or worse\n",
    "availability in neighborhoods with different average incomes?\n",
    ">4. Predicting with a defined degree certainty if a bus is coming within a given time frame\n",

    "We want to work with the Kaggle dataset so head over <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/stoney71/new-york-city-transport-statistics\">here</a> and download the zip file. (A word of caution: the dataset is approx **5GB** when extracted!)\n",
